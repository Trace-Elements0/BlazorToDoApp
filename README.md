# BlazorToDoApp
Followed a tutorial and learned how to build and modify a Blazor app. 
By creating a todo list Blazor app project I modified Razor components, used event handling and data binding in components, and used routing in a Blazor app. I took it one step further and added a simple calculator to the Blazor App as a self-check. Really glad I was able to make this simple addition. Really excited to see what else I can add to it later on.
